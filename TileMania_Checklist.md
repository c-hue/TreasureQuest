## 🪞 Reflection Questions

Answer these in **2–4 sentences each**. These are the same questions you'll revisit across all four projects — track how your thinking evolves!

**1. What was your rapid prototype goal for this project?**

_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

**2. How closely did your final game match your original prototype vision? What changed and why?**

_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

**3. What is the most technically challenging thing you implemented? How did you solve it?**

_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

**4. If you had one more week, what would you add or change?**

_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

**5. How does your approach to game development now compare to when you started the course?**

_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

## 🆘 Stuck? Try These Steps

**Before asking for help:**
1. ☐ Read the **error message** in Console carefully — it tells you the file and line number
2. ☐ Check the **Inspector** — is every serialized field assigned?
3. ☐ Check **Tags and Layers** — are layers set correctly?
4. ☐ Checked the **Layer Collision Matrix**?
5. ☐ Searched the error message in the Unity Docs or Discord?
6. ☐ Tried rubber-duck debugging (explain the code out loud line by line)?

**If still stuck:** Post in Discord with:
- Screenshot of the **Console error**
- Screenshot of the **Inspector** for the relevant GameObject
- The **script** causing the issue
